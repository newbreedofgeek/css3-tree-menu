CSS3 Tree Menu
==============

A tree menu built using mostly CSS3 and very minimal Javascript.

Have a look at menu.png to see what it looks like.

Known Issues:
-------------
1) When your selection at a root level, selects all children. And you individually un-select children, the logic to unselect the parents is not 100% perfect.
